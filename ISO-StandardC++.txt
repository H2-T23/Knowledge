Where To Get the Current Standard

	Purchase the C++ 14 offical standard(US$212, working on getting this down to $60).
	You can purchase the offical C++ 11 standard at the ANSI Store.

	Download the November 2011 working draft(free). 
	Except only for the final standards/reports, all C+ committe documents are freely
	publicly available, including all working drafts, many of which closely approximate 
	the published standard. This working draft contains the C++ 14 standard plus minor editorial changes.

Where To Get Working Drafts

	Download a PDF of the current working draft(free).
	This is the easiest way to get the latest prebuilt PDF. However, you can also...

	Get working drafts at GitHub(free), plus version histroy, diffs, and more! 
	The LaTeX source of the draft standard is being actively maintained publicly at GitHub.
	Check out the repo to get the current snapshot, or any previous version in the history.

FAQs

Q: Why is the standard hard ot read? I'm having trouble learning C++ from reading it.
	
	Please note that the standard is not intended to teach how to use C++.
	Rather, it is an internatonal treaty - a formal, legal, and sometmes 
	mind-numbingly detailed technical document intended primarly for people writing C++
	compilers and standard library implementations.

	Fortunately, there are lost of good books that do teach how to use C++!
	See thse recommendations as a starting pont for high-quality tutorial and reference information 
	about how to learn and use C++.

Q: Why are the C++ working drafts freely available on GitHub when the standard must be purchased 
	from ISO or another standards organiaztion?

	ISO holds the copyright for all balloted drafts of the standard, as well as the standard itself.
	The GitHub repo contains the incremental in-progress working source snapshots as they are edited, 
	which are not the final standars.

	The only documents that C++ committee permitted to provide freely are the final published standards.
	The draft repository on GitHub dose not contain the final source for any published standards.
	It contains interim working materials only, and those differ in their contents from the published standards.

	1.Get a Compiler

		Theree are good free C++ compilers available for all major OS platforms.
		Download one that suits your platform:

		[Gnu Compiler Collection]: Includes g++, a popular C++ compiler. A build for Windows is available here,
		builds for other platforms are likely available via your platform's package manager, 
		or you can build it yourself using instructions here.

		[CLang]: A new open-source C++ compiler for various platforms.

		[Visual C++ 2013 Express for Windows Desktop Apps and Windows 8.x Apps]: A free Windows C++ compiler by Microsoft.

		[Oracle Solaris Studio C++ Compiler]: A C++ compiler for Solaris and some distributions of Linux, 
		free for all commercial and non-commercial use.


		Or try one of these onlin compiler pages, which offer a range of compilers including the latest from CLang, GCC, Intel,
		and Microsoft. Some are compiler-only to let you check whether your code is legal, 
		and some let you also run your test programs to see their output.

	2. Take a Tour

		Here are three great ways to get an overview of modern C++11 and C++14
		- two for people who already know C++ and want to see what's new, and one that covers modern C++ end to end.


		"What's new" in to minutes, If you already know C++ and want quick highligghts of what's new in C++, 
		see Elements of Modern C++ Style by Herb Sutter for an overview of the most obvious and pervasively useful differences
		in C++11 comparad to Classis C++98.(free)
